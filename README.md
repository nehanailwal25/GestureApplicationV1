1.	Introduction:
In this Application, we designed a mobile application for gesture recognition and drawing the best approximation shapes for users drawing according to their choice.
For doing so we have made a design area in which the user is free to draw in all the manners possible. Also, we have provided 2 types of pallets for the user to choose from (one with outlined shapes and one with filled shapes) along with the color choices for the drawings. We have used some standard shapes of rectangle, square, circle, triangle, and line as shown in Image 4.1.2.

2.	Learning Objectives: 
In this design, we expect the user to learn how accurate was the gesture made by them. The variation will let the participant know what variance was there compared to the approximate design made by the application.

3.	Instructions for the participants:
We had given some general instructions to the participants in the app itself.
Instructions provided:
•	After clicking on the Start button, On the left side of the screen, you will see a color dial, you can select the color of your choice for drawing with this.
•	After selection, Draw any rough shape you wish, by moving your finger on the screen.
•	Once your drawing is done you can click on the exact shape you want to see either outlined or filled from the pallets.
•	Once you are done with all drawings. You can check for any overlapping of shapes, if anything is found like this you can click on the delete icon and touch on the targeted shapes, this will remove that overlapping shape.
•	Once done, you will see a tick icon in place of delete that will save the changes and you can start drawing again.
